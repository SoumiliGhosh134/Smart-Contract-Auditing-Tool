# Smart Contract Auditing Tool

## 📚 Project Description
The **Smart Contract Auditing Tool** is a decentralized platform built on Aptos that helps audit smart contracts by allowing auditors to submit and retrieve audit reports. The platform provides a secure and immutable way to assess vulnerabilities and errors in smart contracts.

## 🚀 Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a robust auditing mechanism that empowers developers and enterprises to ensure the safety and integrity of their smart contracts. By leveraging blockchain transparency and immutability, the platform ensures that audit reports are reliable and tamper-proof.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- **Automated Vulnerability Detection:** Integrate AI and ML algorithms to identify vulnerabilities automatically.
- **Audit Report Marketplace:** Allow auditors to publish their reports and offer audit services.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Support for auditing smart contracts written in different blockchain languages.
- **Rating and Reputation System:** Build a reputation system to rate auditors and validate audit quality.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Submit Audit Report:** Auditors can submit reports that summarize the findings and risk level.
- **Retrieve Audit Report:** Users can query an address to get the audit report stored on-chain.
- **Immutable Storage:** Audit reports are stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **Risk Level Assessment:** Reports include a risk level score on a scale of 0 to 10, providing a quick overview of the contract's safety.

## 📄 Smart Contract Overview

### Module: `MyModule::AuditTool`
```move
module MyModule::AuditTool {

    use aptos_framework::signer;
    use std::string;

    /// Struct to store audit results.
    struct AuditReport has store, key {
        result: string::String,  // Audit result summary
        risk_level: u8,          // Risk level (0 - 10 scale)
    }

    /// Function to submit an audit report.
    public fun submit_audit(owner: &signer, result: string::String, risk_level: u8) {
        let report = AuditReport {
            result,
            risk_level,
        };
        move_to(owner, report);
    }

    /// Function to get the audit report of a smart contract.
    public fun get_audit_report(auditor: address): AuditReport acquires AuditReport {
        borrow_global<AuditReport>(auditor)
    }
}
📝 How to Use
Submit an Audit Report

Call submit_audit(owner: &signer, result: string::String, risk_level: u8) to submit an audit.
result: Summary of the audit findings.
risk_level: Risk assessment on a scale of 0 to 10.
Retrieve an Audit Report

Call get_audit_report(auditor: address) to get the audit report for a particular address.
